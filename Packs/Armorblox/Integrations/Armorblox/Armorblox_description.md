## Armorblox

To configure an instance of Armorblox integration in Cortex XSOAR:

- Provide 'TENANT NAME'
    Copy the tenant name from your Armorblox URL (TENANTNAME.armorblox.com).

- Provide 'API Key'
    Create an API Key in Armorblox. Navigate to `Settings --> API Keys` and click on `+Create API Key` to generate a new API key. Specify a descriptive name (e.g. Cortex) and click `Create`. The key will be displayed once in a popup window and must be copied and saved in a secure location. The API keys thus created should never be shared with anyone other than internal Armorblox admins. The API key must be included with each GET request
